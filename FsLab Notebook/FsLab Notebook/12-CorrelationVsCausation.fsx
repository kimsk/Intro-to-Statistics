Correlation vs. Causation
=========================

Note for [Correlation vs. Causation] unit.

#### Correlation

If one variable tells something about other variables (linear or not), the data are ]correlated].

#### Causation

[Causation] is the relation between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is understood as a consequence of the first.

[Correlation does not imply causation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)
